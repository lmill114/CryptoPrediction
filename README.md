ECGR 4106:  Real-Time Machine Learning
Final Project:  Cryptocurrency Price Estimation with Quantitative and Qualitative Factors
By:  Layton Miller, Adam Damreh, and Matthew Ewert

## Overview

This repository contains a cryptocurrency price prediction system that combines price data analysis with deep learning techniques. The project implements multiple model architectures to predict future cryptocurrency prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.

## Project Structure

- **Code/**
  - Core prediction models and analysis tools
  - Technical indicators implementation
  - Feature importance analysis
  - Market cycle detection
  - Temporal feature engineering

- **Models/**
  - Pre-trained models for BTC, ETH, and DOGE
  - Multiple architectures (RNN, GRU, LSTM, Transformer)

- **VisualsGenerated/**
  - Performance visualizations
  - Prediction charts
  - Loss comparisons

## Implementation

The project implements several approaches to cryptocurrency prediction:

1. Base models using historical price data
2. Enhanced models incorporating technical indicators
3. Analysis tools for feature importance and market cycles

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- yfinance (for data acquisition)

## Usage

See the README.md in the Code directory for detailed usage instructions.
